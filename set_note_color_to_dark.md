Notice that:
- color for both body and headers text is set to _white_

- background-color is set to _#474749_, which is the shade chosen by Rosmaninho for this dark theme 

- the color of the line for blockquotes is set to _solid darkgrey_ to distinguish it from the background

You may change these parameters by setting different colors in the `note.color.dark.css` string.
